## Language Variants

If a resource has multiple language variants and the difference between variants is only in the language of human-readable fields, then the Accept-Language request HTTP header **SHOULD** be used to select the desired language variant.

### Example

    GET /article HTTP/1.1
    Accept-Language: en,en-US,fr;q=0.6
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
    Content-Language: en
    Vary: Accept-Language
 
    ...

## Language or Country-specific Data Structure

If the difference between language or country-specific variants of a resource is bigger than just in the content of human-readable strings, for example, the data structure of the resource representation is different, then a query parameter **SHOULD** be used to communicate the requested variant.

### Example

    GET /article?market=en_US HTTP/1.1
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
    Content-Language: en
    Vary: Accept-Language
 
    ...
