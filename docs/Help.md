# Help and Feedback for the Forge REST API Standard

The Slack channel [#forge-api-standards](https://autodesk.slack.com/messages/CA9RED21E) is the best place to ask questions and give feedback about the standard. You may also contact [Scott Morrison](mailto:scott.morrison@autodesk.com) directly.

## Contributing

The Forge REST API Standard is a living document, and is still open to contribution. The standard is maintained in a [git repository](https://git.autodesk.com/forge/forge-api-standards). The Issues section of the git repository is used to discuss ongoing changes and extensions, and we use Pull Requests to make changes to the standard. Updates are encouraged, but the changes must be backward compatible with the existing standards. We can't invalidate released APIs.

Adherence to the standard is required for all APIs publicly release on the Autodesk Platform Services developer portal. It is also recommended for all internal APIs as well, for both consistency, and to make it easier to release internal APIs to the public in the future.
